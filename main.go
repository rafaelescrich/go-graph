The basic operations provided by a graph data structure G usually include:[1]

adjacent(G, x, y): tests whether there is an edge from the vertex x to the vertex y;
neighbors(G, x): lists all vertices y such that there is an edge from the vertex x to the vertex y;
add_vertex(G, x): adds the vertex x, if it is not there;
remove_vertex(G, x): removes the vertex x, if it is there;
add_edge(G, x, y): adds the edge from the vertex x to the vertex y, if it is not there;
remove_edge(G, x, y): removes the edge from the vertex x to the vertex y, if it is there;
get_vertex_value(G, x): returns the value associated with the vertex x;
set_vertex_value(G, x, v): sets the value associated with the vertex x to v.
Structures that associate values to the edges usually also provide:[1]

get_edge_value(G, x, y): returns the value associated with the edge (x, y);
set_edge_value(G, x, y, v): sets the value associated with the edge (x, y) to v.
